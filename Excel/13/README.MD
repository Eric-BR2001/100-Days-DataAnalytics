# 📈 FAANG Stock Market Analysis with Excel

This Excel project aims to analyze historical stock data from the FAANG companies — **Facebook (Meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (Alphabet)** — using Excel functions such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `PROCV` (the Portuguese version of `VLOOKUP`). The data spans from **2018 to 2024**, covering major financial events and market shifts.

## 📊 Objective

Analyze the stock market performance of FAANG companies:

- By **month**, **semester**, and **year**.
- Identify trends in **stock prices** and **trading volumes**.
- Use key Excel functions (`SOMA`, `CONT.VALORES`, `PROCV`) to extract insights.

## 🔍 Excel Functions Used

- `SOMA`: To calculate total trading volume or price summation.
- `CONT.VALORES`: To count the number of trading days per period.
- `PROCV`: To look up specific stock values or company data.

## 🕵️‍♀️ Financial Context & Crisis References

This dataset covers significant market events:
- **COVID-19 Pandemic (2020):** Caused a global market crash in March 2020.
- **Tech Selloff (2022):** Many tech stocks, including FAANG, saw a sharp decline due to rising interest rates and inflation fears.
