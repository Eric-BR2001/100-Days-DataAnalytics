## ðŸ§ª What You'll Work With

The `Day3_PowerQuery_TextPrep.xlsx` file includes:

| Raw Feedback                                  | Cleaned Feedback (Power Query Target) | Lowercase (Example) | Trimmed (Example) | Notes                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|

## ðŸ§° Power Query Tasks

Use Power Query to apply the following steps:

1. **Trim whitespace**  
   `Transform > Format > Trim`

2. **Convert to lowercase**  
   `Transform > Format > Lowercase`

3. **Remove punctuation**  
   `Transform > Replace Values`  
   Replace characters like `.`, `,`, `!`, `?` with nothing (`""`)

4. **Remove extra spaces**  
   Use `Clean` or `Text.Replace(Text, "  ", " ")` in Power Query formula bar

## ðŸ§¼ Output Example

After cleaning, the feedback:

```text
"   delivery was LATE and packaging damaged   "
````

becomes:

```text
"delivery was late and packaging damaged"
```
