# 1- Average Subarray

**Walmart Python Interview Question**

This repository contains the solution to a common interview question asked by companies like Walmart: finding the **maximum average value** of a contiguous subarray of fixed length `k`.

## üß© Problem Description

Given:

* An integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements.
* An integer `k`.

Your task is to find the **contiguous subarray** of length `k` that has the **highest average value** and return this value **rounded to two decimal places**.

A subarray is a consecutive portion of the original array.

### üîç Examples

#### Example 1

```python
Input: nums = [1, 2, -5, -3, 10, 3], k = 3
Output: 3.33
```

**Explanation:** The subarray `[-3, 10, 3]` has the highest average: (‚àí3 + 10 + 3) / 3 = 3.33

#### Example 2

```python
Input: nums = [9], k = 1
Output: 9.00
```

**Explanation:** Only one element, so the average is 9.00.
