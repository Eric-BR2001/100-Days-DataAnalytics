# Uncovering the World's Oldest Businesses 🏛️

**Project Overview**

Longevity in business is rare — but a handful of companies have managed to survive for centuries. In this project, you'll analyze data from [BusinessFinancing.co.uk](https://businessfinancing.co.uk) to uncover the **world's oldest businesses** and the patterns behind their survival.

Using SQL-based techniques like **joins**, **aggregation**, and **data filtering**, you’ll explore which regions, industries, and conditions are best suited for business longevity.
