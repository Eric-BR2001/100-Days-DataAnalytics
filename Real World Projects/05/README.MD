# Examining the History of Lego Sets

Use a variety of data manipulation techniques to explore different aspects of Lego's history.

## Project Description

The Rebrickable dataset includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold â€” the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, you will use this dataset together with the pandas library to dig into the history of Lego's licensed sets, including uncovering the percentage of all licensed sets that are Star Wars themed.

## Project Objective

The team responsible for the Star Wars partnership has asked for specific information in preparation for their meeting:

* **What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?**
  Save your answer as a variable `the_force`, as an integer (e.g. `25`).

* **In which year was the highest number of Star Wars sets released?**
  Save your answer as a variable `new_era`, as an integer (e.g. `2012`).
