# Cleaning Bank Marketing Campaign Data

This project focuses on tidying and restructuring a bank marketing campaign dataset by splitting it into logical subsets, updating values, converting data types, and saving the results into separate CSV files.

## Project Description

The original dataset, `cc_approvals.data`, contains information collected during a marketing campaign by a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to clean and reformat the dataset by:

* Splitting it into three meaningful subsets: `client`, `campaign`, and `economics`
* Updating and cleaning values to ensure consistency and accuracy
* Converting columns to the appropriate data types
* Exporting the cleaned subsets into separate CSV files
