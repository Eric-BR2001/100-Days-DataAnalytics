{"cells":[{"source":"![Credit card being held in hand](credit_card.jpg)\n\nCommercial banks receive _a lot_ of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this workbook, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like real banks do.\n\n### The Data\n\nThe data is a small subset of the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository showing the credit card applications a bank receives. This dataset has been loaded as a `pandas` DataFrame called `cc_apps`. The last column in the dataset is the target value.","metadata":{},"id":"35aebf2e-0635-4fef-bc9a-877b6a20fb13","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Load the dataset\ncc_apps = pd.read_csv(\"cc_approvals.data\", header=None)\n\n# Replace '?' with NaN\ncc_apps.replace('?', np.nan, inplace=True)\n\n# Identify categorical and numerical columns\ncategorical_cols = [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13]\nnumerical_cols = [2, 7, 10, 12]\n\n# Fill missing values\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nimputer_cat = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')\ncc_apps[categorical_cols] = imputer_cat.fit_transform(cc_apps[categorical_cols])\n\nimputer_num = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')\ncc_apps[numerical_cols] = imputer_num.fit_transform(cc_apps[numerical_cols])\n\n# Encode categorical variables\nle = LabelEncoder()\nfor col in categorical_cols:\n    cc_apps[col] = le.fit_transform(cc_apps[col])\n\n# Encode the target variable\ncc_apps[13] = le.fit_transform(cc_apps[13])\n\n# Split data into features and target\nX = cc_apps.iloc[:, :-1]\ny = cc_apps.iloc[:, -1]\n\n# Split into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Standardize features\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)\n\n# Train models with GridSearchCV\nresults = {}\n\n# Logistic Regression\nparam_grid_lr = {'C': [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]}\ngrid_lr = GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000), param_grid_lr, cv=5)\ngrid_lr.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\nresults['LogisticRegression'] = grid_lr.best_score_\n\n# Random Forest\nparam_grid_rf = {'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200], 'max_depth': [None, 5, 10]}\ngrid_rf = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid_rf, cv=5)\ngrid_rf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\nresults['RandomForest'] = grid_rf.best_score_\n\n# SVM\nparam_grid_svm = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}\ngrid_svm = GridSearchCV(SVC(), param_grid_svm, cv=5)\ngrid_svm.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\nresults['SVM'] = grid_svm.best_score_\n\n# Select best model\nbest_model = grid_rf.best_estimator_\n\n# Predict on test set\ny_pred = best_model.predict(X_test_scaled)\n\n# Get accuracy on test set\nbest_score = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"Model scores (cross-validation):\", results)\nprint(\"Best model test accuracy:\", best_score)\n","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":80,"type":"stream"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":null},"id":"6e86b1e8-a3fa-4b09-982f-795f218bd1a6","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
