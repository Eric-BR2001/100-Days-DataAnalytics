# 📺 Extracting TV Data Insights

This project explores historical Super Bowl data to uncover trends and insights related to TV viewership, game outcomes, and halftime show performances. It involves data manipulation and visualization using Python (likely with pandas, matplotlib, and/or seaborn).

## 🔍 Project Objectives

The analysis is centered around three key questions:

1. **Has TV viewership increased over time?**
   → The result is stored in the boolean variable: `viewership_increased`

2. **How many Super Bowl matches ended with a point difference greater than 40?**
   → The result is stored as an integer: `difference`

3. **Who performed the most songs during a Super Bowl halftime show?**
   → The result is stored as a string: `most_songs`
