# üåæ Predictive Modeling for Agriculture

This project leverages **supervised machine learning** and **feature selection** to support farmers in making data-driven decisions about crop cultivation. By analyzing agricultural datasets, we aim to uncover the most informative features that can accurately predict crop types.

## üß† Objective

The primary goal is to **identify the single feature** in the dataset that offers the **strongest predictive performance** for classifying crop types. This helps to simplify models, reduce computational costs, and highlight the most important data points for agricultural decisions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**: Analyze and preprocess the dataset to ensure high-quality input data.
2. **Feature Evaluation**: Test each feature independently using a chosen classification algorithm and evaluation metric.
3. **Model Training**: Apply a supervised learning model (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Logistic Regression).
4. **Metric Calculation**: Evaluate model performance using a suitable metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score).
5. **Best Feature Selection**: Determine the feature with the highest evaluation score for predicting the `"crop"` column.
