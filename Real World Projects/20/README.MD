# 🧠 Tech Talent Recruiting with Regex

Use the power of regular expressions and data preprocessing to identify top tech job candidates from thousands of resumes.

## 📝 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world HR consultancy scenario, where the goal is to automate the screening of resumes to extract key information and build a structured dataset of potential tech candidates.

By applying **regular expressions** and **data cleaning techniques**, you'll transform unstructured resume data into a clean and actionable format.

## 📊 Objective

Generate a new `DataFrame` named `candidates_df` containing the following structured fields:

* `id`: Unique candidate ID
* `job_title`: Most recent job title
* `tech_skills`: A list of identified technical skills (e.g., `Python`, `SQL`, `R`, `Excel`)
* `education`: Highest academic degree (`PhD`, `Master`, or `Bachelor`)
