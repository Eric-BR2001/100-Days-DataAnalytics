# ðŸ“˜ SQL Guide: LIMIT, UNION, and Subqueries  

## ðŸ“Œ Description  
This guide provides a deep dive into essential SQL concepts related to:  
- **LIMIT clause** (restricting the number of rows returned, using OFFSET)  
- **UNION and UNION ALL** (combining multiple result sets efficiently)  
- **Subqueries** (nested queries, correlated subqueries, and different use cases)  

With clear explanations and real-world examples, this guide helps users optimize their queries and improve SQL performance.  

## ðŸ“– Topics Covered  

### ðŸ”¹ LIMIT Clause  
- **Restricting query results** using `LIMIT`  
- **Pagination with OFFSET** (e.g., fetching data in chunks for web applications)  
- **Performance considerations when using LIMIT**  


### ðŸ”¹ UNION and UNION ALL  
- **UNION** â€“ Combines results from multiple queries while removing duplicates  
- **UNION ALL** â€“ Combines results while keeping duplicates  
- **Performance differences and best practices**  


### ðŸ”¹ Subqueries  
- **Types of Subqueries:**  
  - **In the WHERE clause** (filtering based on another query)  
  - **In the FROM clause** (using subqueries as virtual tables)
