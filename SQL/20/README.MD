# ðŸ“˜ SQL Guide: Text interpretation skills

## Description:
We need to create a theory-focused section in the project that explains key SQL concepts while helping users develop their text interpretation skills. The idea is to present explanations, query examples, and problem scenarios in a way that encourages the reader to carefully interpret the structure and meaning of the statements.

## Goals:
Teach SQL fundamentals (e.g., SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.)

Include reading-based exercises that require understanding and analyzing SQL queries

Encourage interpretation of both queries and natural language problem statements

Use simple but effective language, especially for beginners

## Suggestions:
Introduce theory in short, focused segments

Include real-world examples that simulate reading comprehension challenges

Add multiple-choice questions or open-ended interpretation exercises after each concept

Include common traps or misunderstandings in SQL to train attention to detail

## Resources (Optional):
Reference to documentation or SQL tutorials

Short articles or examples on improving text interpretation through programming

## Resolution
The SQL theory section with a focus on text interpretation has been added successfully. It includes core SQL concepts, comprehension-based exercises, and real-world examples designed to strengthen both technical and reading skills
