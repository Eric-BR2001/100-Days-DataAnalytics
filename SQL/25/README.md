## üîå Project 1: EV Charging Behavior Analysis

As electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, apartment buildings are installing shared EV charging stations. With increased demand, building managers face a key question:  
**How can we optimize shared charging infrastructure to meet tenants‚Äô needs?**

This project leverages data analysis and SQL on a PostgreSQL database to uncover charging habits and inform infrastructure planning.

### üß† Objective

Analyze EV charging sessions to:
- Understand usage patterns
- Identify high-demand time slots
- Detect long-duration users
- Support decisions for scaling infrastructure

### üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Overview

Data is stored in a table called `charging_sessions` containing session logs.

#### Table: `charging_sessions`

| `end_plugout_hour`   | Hour the session ended                          | `NUMERIC` |
| `duration_hours`     | Duration of the session (hours)                 | `NUMERIC` |
| `el_kwh`             | Energy used (kWh)                               | `NUMERIC` |
| `month_plugin`       | Month the session started                       | `VARCHAR` |
| `weekdays_plugin`    | Weekday the session started                     | `VARCHAR` |

### üìä Sample SQL Queries

#### 1. Unique Shared Station Users per Garage
```sql
SELECT garage_id, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS num_unique_users
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY garage_id
ORDER BY num_unique_users DESC;
```

#### 2. Most Popular Charging Times (Shared)
```sql
SELECT weekdays_plugin,
       start_plugin_hour, 
       COUNT(*) AS num_charging_sessions
FROM charging_sessions
WHERE user_type = 'Shared'
GROUP BY weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour
ORDER BY num_charging_sessions DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### 3. Long Duration Shared Users
```sql
SELECT user_id, 
       AVG(duration_hours) as avg_charging_duration
FROM charging_sessions 
WHERE user_type = 'Shared' 
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING AVG(duration_hours) > 10
ORDER BY avg_charging_duration DESC;
```

## üåç Project 2: Industry Carbon Emissions Analysis

Product-related emissions‚Äîincluding manufacturing, transportation, and use‚Äîaccount for over **75% of global greenhouse gas emissions**. This project explores emissions at the product and industry level using SQL and a PostgreSQL database.

### üß† Objective

- Analyze carbon footprints across products and industries  
- Identify high-emission sectors  
- Encourage data-driven sustainability practices

### üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Overview

Data is stored in the `product_emissions` table, detailing carbon metrics by product.

#### Table: `product_emissions`

| Column                          | Description                                      | Data Type |

GROUP BY industry_group
ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;
```
